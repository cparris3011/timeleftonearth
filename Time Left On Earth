This program is using math and f-strings that tells us how many days, weeks, and months we have left on earth if we live until 90 years old.

age_as_int = int(age)

years_remaining = 90 - age_as_int
days_remaining = years_remaining * 365
weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
months_remaining = years_remaining * 12

print(months_remaining)

message = (f" You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks, {months_remaining} months left.")

print(message)
